# Silly

Silly is a general purpose project templating CLI tool designed to use templates from repositories or other sources to create projects in any language for any purpose.
This tool is built with creation-time project customization in mind, allowing templates to specify variables to be replaced within files. Furthermore, this project uses
the [Liquid Templating Language](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) to allow files templates to be defined according to complex rules.
